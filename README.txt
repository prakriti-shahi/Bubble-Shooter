A game created by Prakriti Shahi in her freshman year of undergraduate education under the supervision of Professor Parag Chaudhari from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. This game was a course project for the course CS101, Computer Programming and Utilization. 

The game has the following features:
1. The 3 required features:
  a) Modify the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path. When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it should bounce off the ground.
  b) Introduce collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision, you can make the bullet disappear too.
  c) Introduce collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.
2. 2 additional features:
  a) Use bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, they should split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions.
  b) Add a score, time and a health counter. The score increases whenever you hit a bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).
